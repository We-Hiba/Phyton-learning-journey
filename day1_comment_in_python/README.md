Let's talk about comments in a Python code :

1. A very important aspect of programming is docummenting what i am doing , i learn that in python you can add comments to my code to make it more understandbale in case other poeple what's to look at it , i think leaning how to well comment your code is important in case you are working on projects since you will not be alone doing it .

2. I can add comments using the # symbole 
EX : 

   (#) This is a comment  ( Everything after the # symbole is ignored when running a code )
print(10)

3. You can even add comments at the end of an existing code line . This is called an inline comment :
EX: 

print(10) # I am an inline comment 

4. Using comments, we can structure our code and make it very clear what our program is doing :
EX : 

# 1. Declare the variable :

name = 'Hiba' 
age = 23

# 2. Updatting the age :

age = 24   # I will soon be 24 that is why i updatted my age lol

# Printing the values :

print(name)
print(age)
