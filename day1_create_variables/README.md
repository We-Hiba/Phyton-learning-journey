Creating a Variable in Python :

. Variables are like containers that store informations for later use and to vreate it we use the = symbole . EX : num = 10  ( This code will create a variable that's called num with a value of 10 .

. Make sure when you name your variables name them in a way that best describes the value they store . I think it's important as well in order to make your code clear when working in a group .

. To display the value of an already existing variable , we use the print() function . 
EX: 

name = 'Hiba'
print(name)  # After running this code the name Hiba will be displayed in the output window . 

. When you have created a variable you can always reassign a new value to it .
EX: 

name = 'Hiba'    # The output will be Hiba 
print(name)

name = 'Juyun'   # The output will be Juyun 
print(name)
