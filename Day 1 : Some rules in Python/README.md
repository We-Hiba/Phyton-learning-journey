In python naming a variable has some rules to fallow :

1. A variable name cannot start with a number EX : 1_num 

2. Pyhton will not accept any special characters like .-+:,;()/#*'"? in the variable name . They are reseced for other functionalities . It will give you an error if you run it 

3. Also, be aware that variable names are case sentive ( Uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as different ) EX : num = 10  and NUM = 5 

4. Another important aspect of python syntax is indentation (The whitespace at the beginning of a code line ) it will give an error if you run the code .
