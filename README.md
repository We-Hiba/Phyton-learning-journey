Hi ! I joined Github in order to document my jurney into learning Python from scratch in a period of 4 months i will share my everyday learnings day by day, including what to learn , my notes , projects and the problems i migh face and how to solve them if that happens .

Nice to meet you !
Wish me luck !


Day 1 : 
🧠 What to learn : install Python 3.13 64 bit set it up then open IDLE (for now since i just started then later i will start using Jupyter notebook, then learn how to run small scripst of Python, then finally learn how to print basic data types .


If you want to know about the basic data types i started with, click on this link here  -> - 🗓️ [Day 1 – Basic Data Types](day1_data_types/)

After learning each data type and what they are , now it is time to run simple codes in IDLE .

Let's start with the classic Hello, World ! 💻
In python we dont need any introductions or main like we do in C programming we start directly .
This is the python code scrict i wrote ->   print("Hello, World !") , then i saved the file and run it . 🎉
