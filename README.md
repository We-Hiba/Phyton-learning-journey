# Phyton-learning-journey
My journey to master Python from scratch 

Hello! I'm documenting my journey to learn Python from scratch , here i will go step by step from the basics until i reach a high level in Python coding .

This jurney will take a period of 4 months , learning a new skill every day .
I will be documenting every day goals , practices i will do as well as my notes and the problems i might face .

Wish me luck ! 

üêç DAY 1 : 

_ WHAT TO LEARN üß† : first install Python ( IDDLE )for now since I just started then maybe later Jupyter notebook and learn how to run Phyton scripts then finally learn how to print variables with basic data types .
