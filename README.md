Hi ! I joined Github in order to document my jurney into learning Python from scratch in a period of 4 months i will share my everyday learnings day by day, including what to learn , my notes , projects and the problems i migh face and how to solve them if that happens .

Nice to meet you !
Wish me luck !


Day 1 : 
🧠 What to learn : install Python 3.13 64 bit set it up then open IDLE (for now since i just started then later i will start using Jupyter notebook, then learn how to run small scripst of Python, then finally learn how to print basic data types .


If you want to know about the basic data types i started with, click on this link here  -> - 🗓️ [Day 1 – Basic Data Types](day1_data_types/)

After learning each data type and what they are , now it is time to run simple codes in IDLE .

Let's start with the classic Hello, World ! 💻
In python we dont need any introductions or main like we do in C programming we start directly .
 
Click on the link here if you want to see the python code scrict i wrote -> - [Day 1 – Hello World](hello_world.py) 🎉

Next is how to print the sum of two integers , while doing that i found out that there is a lot of ways to print based on what you want exactly , so here are two ways to use inside the function print 
-> [Day 1 - The sum of two integers](sum_two_integers.py) 🎉

Here is a link of a printing of the sun of two floats -> [Day 1 - The sum of two floats](sum_two_float.py) 🎉

This link will show u how to create variables in python -> [Day 1 - Variables in Python](day1_create_variables/)

This is a link for all the valid syntax in variable namimg : - >[Day 1 : Rules for Python](day1_rules_in_python/) 🎉

This is a link to learn about comments in Python and how to use them to structure and describe our code. -> [Day 1 Comments in Python](day1_comments_in_python) 🎉

This is the ned of Day one YEY !!! To be honest it was not that hard , it was fun and simple , the only thing i will tell myself to remember is that Python read the code line by line from up to down . Never forget that . Good job and stay motivated until Day 2 .
