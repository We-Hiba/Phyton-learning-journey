a = 2
b = 3
c = a + b

print("The sum of a and b is : " , c )    -> The sum of a and b is : 5

print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {c} " )   -> The sum of 2 and 3 is : 5 




In the first exemple we see that the sentence inside the quotes will result in the exact sentence written inside exept of c that result in the value of it .
In the second exemple the result of a and b is different because adding f before oppening the quotes will allow you to get the values of a and b if you put them inside these { } , same thing for c , you can include it inside the quotes and not after it .
